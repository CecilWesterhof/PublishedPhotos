# PublishedPhotos
A little web application to show the Photo's I published on Google+

You need python3 with bottle and AngularJS.
You need to install your favorite AngularJS in: static/JavaScript/angular.js.

You need a links.sqlite. You can create a version (with my data) with createDB.py.

You start the server with startServer.
You go to the application with: localhost:8080/

There is still a lot to be done. I am open to requests.
You can contact me on: PublishedPhotos@Decebal.nl.

There is also a script to test the time needed to fetch the main page:
- testFetch.py

This uses time_fetchURLs from: https://github.com/CecilWesterhof/PythonLibrary/blob/master/utilDecebal.py
